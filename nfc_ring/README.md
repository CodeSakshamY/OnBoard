NFC RING

There are various smart rings in the market with costs that are very high.
I made a basic pcb which i will put inside a ring making a basic smart ring which does not require a battery for normal students who just need it for nfc and not the rest work.
This will fulfill the wish of students to own rings at a low cost.

Since i am just ordering 5 to test it out it is costing me 40$ for pcb and around 20$ for shipping.However if ordered in bulk it coukd cost around 4-5$.

Challenges: Making a design that can be put inside a ring with making it too heavy or too big.
